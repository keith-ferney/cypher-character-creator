You’re attractive to others, but perhaps more important, you are
likeable and charismatic. You’ve got that “special something” that draws
others to you. You often know just the right thing to say to make
someone laugh, put them at ease, or spur them to action. People like
you, want to help you, and want to be your friend.

    You gain the following characteristics:

Charismatic:
    +2 to your Intellect Pool.

    Skill:
    You are trained in pleasant social interactions.

    Resistant to Charms:
    You’re aware of how others can manipulate and charm
    people, and you notice when those tactics are used on you. Because of
    this awareness, you are trained in resisting any kind of persuasion or
    seduction if you wish it.

    Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:
    From the following list of
        options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

    1. You met a total stranger (one of the other PCs) and charmed them so much that they invited you along.
    2. The PCs were looking for someone else, but you convinced them that you were perfect instead.
    3. Pure happenstance—because you just go along with the flow of things and everything usually works out.
    4. Your charismatic ways helped get one of the PCs out of a difficult spot a long time ago, and they always ask you to join them on new adventures.

    Helping others is your calling. It’s why you’re here. Others delight in
your outgoing and charitable nature, and you delight in their happiness.
    You’re at your best when you’re aiding people, either by explaining how
they can best overcome a challenge or by demonstrating how to do so
yourself.

You gain the following characteristics:

Generous:
    Allies who have spent the last day with you add +1 to their
    recovery rolls.

    Altruistic:
    If you’re standing next to a creature that takes damage, you
    can intercede and take 1 point of that damage yourself (reducing the
    damage inflicted on the creature by 1 point). If you have Armor, it does
    not provide a benefit when you use this ability.

    Skill:
    You’re trained in all tasks related to pleasant social
    interaction, putting other people at ease, and gaining trust.

    Helpful:
    Whenever you help another character, that character gains the
    benefit as if you were trained even if you are not trained or
    specialized in the attempted task.

    While you are alone, all Intellect and Speed tasks are
    hindered.

    2. You saw the PCs struggling to overcome a problem and selflessly joined them to help.
    3. You’re nearly certain the PCs will fail without you.
    4. The choice was between your tattered life and helping others. You haven’t looked back since.

    Some people call you bold and brave, but those you’ve put in their place
might call you puffed up and arrogant. Whatever. It’s not in your nature
to care what other people think about you, unless those people are your

sometimes have to come first.

    You’ve spent most of your life in sedentary pursuits—books, movies,
hobbies, and so on—rather than active ones. You’re well versed in all
manner of academia or other intellectual pursuits, but nothing physical.
    You’re not weak or feeble, necessarily (although this is a good
descriptor for characters who are elderly), but you have no experience
in more physical activities.

    (Calm is a great descriptor for characters who never intended to have
adventures but were thrust into them, a trope that occurs often in
modern games and particularly in horror games.)

You gain the following characteristics:

Bookish:
    +2 to your Intellect Pool.

    Skills:
    You are trained in four nonphysical skills of your choice.

    Trivia:
    You can come up with a random fact pertinent to the current
    situation when you wish it. This is always a matter of fact, not
    conjecture or supposition, and must be something you could have
    logically read or seen in the past. You can do this one time, although
    the ability is renewed each time you make a recovery roll.

    Inability:
    You’re just not a fighter. All physical attacks are hindered.

Danger doesn’t mean much to you, mainly because you don’t think much
about repercussions. In fact, you enjoy sowing surprises, just to see
what will happen. The more unexpected the result, the happier you are.
    Sometimes you are particularly manic, and for the sake of your
companions, you restrain yourself from taking actions that you know will
lead to disaster.

    You gain the following characteristics:

    Skill:
    You are trained in Intellect defense actions.

    Chaotic:
    Once after each ten-hour recovery roll, if you don’t like the
    first result, you can reroll a die roll of your choice. If you do, and
    regardless of the outcome, the GM presents you with a GM intrusion.

    3. Another PC released you from captivity, and to thank them, you volunteered to help.

    You’re a smooth talker and a charmer. Whether through seemingly
supernatural means or just a way with words, you can convince others to
do as you wish. Most likely, you’re physically attractive or at least
highly charismatic, and others enjoy listening to your voice. You
probably pay attention to your appearance, keeping yourself well
groomed. You make friends easily. You play up the personality facet of
your Intellect stat; intelligence is not your strong suit. You’re
personable, but not necessarily studious or strong-willed.

    You gain the following characteristics:

Personable:
    +2 to your Intellect Pool.

    Skill:
    You’re trained in all tasks involving positive or pleasant social
    interaction.

    Skill:
    You’re trained when using special abilities that influence the
    minds of others.

    Contact:
    You have an important contact who is in an influential
    position, such as a minor noble, the captain of the town guard/police,
    or the head of a large gang of thieves. You and the GM should work out
    the details together.

    Inability:
    You were never good at studying or retaining facts. Any task
    involving lore, knowledge, or understanding is hindered.

    Inability:
    Your willpower is not one of your strong points. Defense
    actions to resist mental attacks are hindered.

    Additional Equipment:
    You’ve managed to talk your way into some decent
    discounts and bonuses in recent weeks. As a result, you have enough cash
    jangling in your pocket to purchase a moderately priced item.

    Graceless and awkward, you were told that you’d grow out of it, but you
never did. You often drop things, trip over your own feet, or knock
things (or people) over. Some people get frustrated by this quality, but
most find it funny and even a little charming.

    (Some players may not want to be defined by a “negative” quality like
Clumsy, but in truth, even this kind of descriptor has enough advantages
that it makes for capable and talented characters. What negative
    descriptors really do is make more interesting and complex characters
that are often great fun to play.)

You gain the following characteristics:

Butterfingers:

    +2 to your Might Pool.

    Inelegant:
    You have a certain lovable charm. You are trained in all
    pleasant social interactions when you express a lighthearted,
    self-deprecating manner.

    Dumb Luck:
    The GM can introduce a GM intrusion on you, based on your
    clumsiness, without awarding you any XP (as if you had rolled a 1 on a
    d20 roll). However, if this happens, 50% of the time, your clumsiness
    works to your advantage. Rather than hurting you (much), it helps you,
    or it hurts your enemies. You slip, but it’s just in time to duck an
    attack. You fall down, but you trip your enemies as you crash into their
    legs. You turn around too quickly, but you end up knocking the weapon
    from your foe’s hand. You and the GM should work together to determine
    the details. If the GM wishes, they can use GM intrusions based on your
    clumsiness normally (awarding XP).

Skill:
    You’ve got a certain bull-like quality. You are trained in tasks
    involving breaking things.

    Inability:
    Any task that involves balance, grace, or hand-to-eye
    coordination is hindered.

    Courage fails you at every turn. You lack the willpower and resolve to
stand fast in the face of danger. Fear gnaws at your heart, chewing away
at your mind, driving you to distraction until you cannot bear it. Most
times, you back down from confrontations. You flee from threats and
    vacillate when faced with difficult decisions.

    Yet for all that fear dogs you and possibly shames you, your cowardly
nature proves to be a useful ally from time to time. Listening to your
fears has helped you escape danger and avoid taking unnecessary risks.
    Others may have suffered in your place, and you might be the first to
admit this fact, but secretly you feel intense relief from having
avoided an unthinkable and terrible fate.

    (Descriptors like Craven, Cruel, and Dishonorable might not be
appropriate for every group. These are villainous traits and some people
want their PCs to be entirely heroic. But others don’t mind a little
moral greyness thrown into the mix. Still others see things like Craven
    and Cruel as traits to overcome as their characters develop (probably
earning them different descriptors).)

    Skill:
    You’re trained in any action taken to escape danger, flee from a
    dangerous situation, or wheedle your way out of trouble.

    Inability:
    You do not willingly enter dangerous situations. Any
    initiative actions (to determine who goes first in combat) are hindered.

    Inability:
    You fall to pieces when you have to undertake a potentially
    dangerous task alone. Any such task (such as attacking a creature by
    yourself) is hindered.

    keep you out of harm’s way.

create narratives that enthrall other people with your vision.

    You’re always coming up with something new. You’re trained in
    any task related to creating a narrative (such as a story, play, or
    scenario). This includes deception, if the deception involves a
    narrative you’re able to tell.

Misfortune and suffering do not move you. When another endures hardship,
you find it hard to care, and you may even enjoy the pain and difficulty
the person experiences if they’ve done you wrong in the past. Your cruel
streak may derive from bitterness brought about by your own struggles
    and disappointments. You might be a hard pragmatist, doing what you feel
you must even if others are worse for it. Or you could be a sadist,
delighting in the pain you inflict.

    Being cruel does not necessarily make you a villain. Your cruelty may be
reserved for those who cross you or other people useful to you. You
might have become cruel as the result of an intensely awful experience.
    Abuse and torture, for example, can strip away compassion for other
                                                                  living beings.

As well, you need not be cruel in every situation. In fact, others might
see you as personable, friendly, and even helpful. But when angered or
    frustrated, your dual nature reveals itself, and those who have earned
your scorn are likely to suffer for it.

    When you use force, you can choose to maim or deliver painful
    injuries to draw out your foe’s suffering. Whenever you inflict damage,
    you can choose to inflict 2 fewer points of damage to ease your next
    attack against that foe.

    Skill:
    You’re trained in tasks related to deception, intimidation, and
    persuasion when you interact with characters experiencing physical or
    emotional pain.

    Inability:
    You have a hard time connecting with others, understanding
    their motives, or sharing their feelings. Any task to ascertain another
    character’s motives, feelings, or disposition is hindered.

    Skill:
    You’re trained in tasks involving sensing other emotions,
    discerning dispositions, and getting a hunch about people around you.

    Skill:
    You’re trained in all tasks involving social interaction,
    pleasant or otherwise.

    Inability:
    Being so receptive to others’ thoughts and moods makes you
    vulnerable to anything that attacks your mind. Intellect defense rolls

    You have walked a long and lonely road, leaving your home and your life
behind. You might have committed a heinous crime, something so awful
that your people forced you out, and if you dare return, you face death.
    You might have been accused of a crime you didn’t commit and now must
pay the price for someone else’s wicked deed. Your exile might be the
result of a social gaffe—perhaps you shamed your family or a friend, or
you embarrassed yourself in front of your peers, an authority, or
someone you respect. Whatever the reason, you have left your old life
behind and now strive to make a new one.

    You gain the following characteristics:

Self-Reliant:

    You gain no benefit when you get help with a task from another

    You’re trained in all tasks involving foraging, hunting, and
    finding safe places to rest or hide.

    Inability:
    Living on your own for as long as you have makes you slow to
    trust others and awkward in social situations. Any task involving social
    interaction is hindered.

    Additional Equipment:
    You have a memento from your past—an old picture,
    a locket with a few strands of hair inside, or a lighter given to you by
    someone important. You keep the object close at hand and pull it out to
    help you remember better times.

you, so why bother? You take things at face value and don’t fret about
what tomorrow might bring.

    People call you “idiot” or “numbskull,” but it doesn’t faze you much.

    (It can be liberating and really fun to play a foolish character. In
some ways, the pressure to always do the right, smart thing is off. On
the other hand, if you play such a character as a bumbling moron in
every situation, that can become annoying to everyone else at the table.
As with everything, moderation is the key.)

is what you care about most, and you prefer to keep everyone else at a
safe distance. You may be suspicious of everyone you meet, expecting the
worst from people so you won’t be surprised when they prove you right.
Or you might just be a bit reserved, careful about letting people
through your gruff exterior to the person you really are.

    No one can be as reserved as you are and make many friends. Most likely,
you have an abrasive personality and tend to be pessimistic in your
outlook. You probably nurse an old hurt and find that the only way you
can cope is to keep it and your personality locked down.

hunger nor thirst, cut flesh nor broken bone can stop you. You just

Almost Unstoppable:
    While you are impaired on the damage track, you
    function as if you were hale. While you are debilitated, you function as
    if you were impaired. In other words, you don’t suffer the effects of
    being impaired until you become debilitated, and you never suffer the

You have a hard time tamping down your enthusiasm. Why wait when you can
just do it (whatever it is) and get it done? You deal with problems when
they arise rather than plan ahead. Putting out the small fires now
prevents them from becoming one big fire later. You are the first to
take risks, to jump in and lend a hand, to step into dark passages, and
to find danger.

    Your impulsiveness likely gets you into trouble. While others might take
time to study the items they discover, you use such items without
hesitation. After all, the best way to learn what something can do is to
use it. When a cautious explorer might look around and check for danger

fuss around when the exciting thing is just ahead?

        (Impulsive characters get into trouble. That’s their thing, and that’s
fine. But if you’re constantly dragging your fellow PCs into trouble (or
worse, getting them seriously hurt or killed), that will be annoying, to
say the least. A good rule of thumb is that impulsiveness doesn’t always
mean a predilection for doing the wrong thing. Sometimes it’s the urge
to do the right thing.)

    It’s always been easy for you to see things from the point of view of
other people. That ability has made you sympathetic to what they really
want or need. From your perspective, you’re just applying the old
proverb that “it’s easier to catch flies with honey than with vinegar,”
but others simply see your behavior as kindness. Of course, being kind
takes time, and yours is limited. You’ve learned that a small fraction
of people don’t deserve your time or kindness—true sadists, narcissists,
and similar folk will only waste your energy. So you deal with them

    Karma:
    Sometimes, strangers just help you out. To gain the aid of a
    stranger, you must use a one action, ten-minute, or one-hour recovery
    roll (without gaining its healing benefit), and the GM determines the
    nature of the aid you gain. Usually, the act of kindness isn’t enough to
    turn a bad situation completely around, but it may moderate a bad
    situation and lead to new opportunities. For example, if you are
    captured, a guard loosens your bonds slightly, brings you water, or
    delivers a message.

You rely on chance and timely good luck to get you through many
situations. When people say that someone was born under a lucky star,
they mean you. When you try your hand at something new, no matter how
unfamiliar the task is, as often as not you find a measure of success.
    Even when disaster strikes, it’s rarely as bad as it could be. More
often, small things seem to go your way, you win contests, and you’re
often in the right place at the right time.

    You gain the following characteristics:

Luck Pool:
    You have one additional Pool called Luck that begins with 3
    points, and it has a maximum value of 3 points. When spending points
    from any other Pool, you can take one, some, or all of the points from
    your Luck Pool first. When you make a recovery roll to recover points to
    any other Pool, your Luck Pool is also refreshed by the same number of
    points. When your Luck Pool is at 0 points, it does not count against
    your damage track. Enabler.

    Advantage:
    When you use 1 XP to reroll a d20 for any roll that affects
    only you, add 3 to the reroll.

    Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:
    From the following list of
        options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

    1. Knowing that lucky people notice and take active advantage of opportunities, you became involved in your first adventure by choice.
    2. You literally bumped into someone else on this adventure through sheer luck.
    3. You found a briefcase lying alongside the road. It was battered, but inside you found a lot of strange documents that led you here.
    4. Your luck saved you when you avoided a speeding vehicle by a fortuitous fall through an opening in the ground (a manhole, if in a modern setting). Beneath the ground, you found something you couldn’t ignore.

    Mad
    ---

    You have delved too deeply into subjects people were not meant to know.
    You are knowledgeable in things beyond the scope of most, but this
knowledge has come at a terrible price. You are likely in questionable
physical shape and occasionally shake with nervous tics. You sometimes
mutter to yourself without realizing it.

    You gain the following characteristics:

Knowledgeable:
    +4 to your Intellect Pool.

    Fits of Insight:
    Whenever such knowledge is appropriate, the GM feeds
    you information although there is no clear explanation as to how you
    could know such a thing. This is up to the GM’s discretion, but it
    should happen as often as once each session.

    Erratic Behavior:
    You are prone to acting erratically or irrationally.
    When you are in the presence of a major discovery or subjected to great
    stress (such as a serious physical threat), the GM can introduce a GM
    intrusion that directs your next action without awarding XP. You can
    still pay 1 XP to refuse the intrusion. The GM’s influence is the
    manifestation of your madness and thus is always something you would not
    likely do otherwise, but it is not directly, obviously harmful to you
    unless there are extenuating circumstances. (For example, if a foe
    suddenly leaps out of the darkness, you might spend the first round
    babbling incoherently or screaming the name of your first true love.)

Skill:
    You are trained in one area of knowledge (probably something
    weird or esoteric).

Inability:
    Your mind is quite fragile. Tasks to resist mental attacks
    are hindered.

    You can attempt one task in which you have no training as if you were
    trained, attempt a task that you are trained in as if specialized, or
    gain a free level of Effort with a task that you are specialized in.
    This ability refreshes every time you make a recovery roll, but the uses

experience with ancient lore, and you can sense and wield the
supernatural—though whether that means “magic,” “psychic phenomena,” or
    something else is up to you (and probably up to those around you as
well). Mystical characters often wear jewelry, such as a ring or an
amulet, or have tattoos or other marks that show their interests.

    situations where its presence is not obvious. You must study an object
    or location closely for a minute to get a feel for whether a mystical
    touch is at work.

    You can perform Hedge Magic as a spell when you have a free hand

haven’t done much, met many people, or seen many interesting things so
far. That’s probably going to change soon, but as you go forward into a
larger world, you do so without some of the understanding that others
possess about how it all works.

talented scout.

As adept as you are at finding clues, you have no skill at picking up on
social cues. You overlook an offense that your deductions give or how
uncomfortable your scrutiny can make the people around you. You tend to
dismiss others as being intellectual dwarfs compared to you, which
avails you little when you need a favor.

leap across a mile-wide chasm just because you were dared. There’s
impossible and then there’s the just barely possible. You like to push
the latter further than others, because it gives you a rush of
satisfaction and pleasure when you succeed. The more you succeed, the
more you find yourself looking for that next risky challenge to try
yourself against.

    You’re adept at leveraging risk, and you are trained in tasks
    that involve some element of chance, such as playing games or choosing
    between two or three apparently equal options.

    Pressing Your Luck:
    You can choose to automatically succeed on one task
    without rolling, as long as the task’s difficulty is no higher than 6.
    When you do so, however, you also trigger a GM intrusion as if you had
    rolled a 1. The intrusion doesn’t invalidate the success, but it
    probably qualifies it in some fashion. You can do this one time,

You’ve never been much of a talker. When forced to interact with others,
you never think of the right thing to say—words fail you entirely, or
they come out all wrong. You often end up saying precisely the wrong
thing and insult someone unintentionally. Most of the time, you just
keep mum. This makes you a listener instead—a careful observer. It also
means that you’re better at doing things than talking about them. You’re
quick to take action.

    You gain the following characteristics:

Actions, Not Words:
    +2 to your Might Pool, and +2 to your Speed Pool.

    Skill:
    You are trained in perception.

    Skill:
    You are trained in initiative (unless it’s a social situation).

Inability:
    All tasks relating to social interaction are hindered.

    Inability:
    All tasks involving verbal communication or relaying
    information are hindered.

    Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:
    From the following list of
        options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

    1. You just tagged along and no one told you to leave.
    2. You saw something important the other PCs did not and (with some effort) managed to relate it to them.
    3. You intervened to save one of the other PCs when they were in danger.
    4. One of the other PCs recruited you for your talents.

You’re strong and can take a lot of physical punishment. You might have
a large frame and a square jaw. Tough characters frequently have visible
scars.

You gain the following characteristics:

Resilient:
    +1 to Armor.

    Healthy:
    Add 1 to the points you regain when you make a recovery roll.

    Skill:
    You’re trained in Might defense actions.

    Additional Equipment:
    You have an extra light weapon.

    4. You stepped in to defend one of the PCs when that character was threatened. While talking to them afterward, you heard about the group’s task.

You try to hide what’s inside, fold it into yourself when everything
inside you screams to let go, make them pay, make them hurt, and make
them bleed. Sometimes you succeed for your friends—smiling like they
smile, laughing when they laugh, and sometimes even having other
emotions of your own. But it’s always there, that feeling of frantic
glee mixed with hate that sometimes leaps out of you when you confront a
foe. Violence your friends can tolerate, but you sometimes worry they
will also learn that you are cruel.

    You gain the following characteristics:

Skill:
    You are trained in tracking creatures. If a creature has wronged
    you, the tracking task is eased.

    Bloodthirsty:
    Once you begin fighting, you see only red. You inflict 2
    additional points of damage with any attack.

    Berserk:
    Once you begin fighting, it’s hard for you to stop. In fact,
    it’s a difficulty 2 Intellect task to do so, even if your foe surrenders
    or you’ve run out of foes. If the latter occurs and you fail to stop,
    you attack the nearest ally within short range.

    Additional Equipment:
    You have a record that you use to list those
        who’ve wronged you.

    Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:
    From the following list of
        options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

    1. Another PC saw you take down a mean drunk in a tavern, not realizing you were the one who started the fight.
    2. You wanted to get away from a bad situation, so you went with the other PCs.
    3. You want to change, and you hope that being with the other PCs will help you calm yourself.
    4. One of the other PCs asked you to come along, believing that your viciousness could be harnessed for the benefit of the mission.

    Doing the right thing is a way of life. You live by a code, and that
code is something you attend to every day. Whenever you slip, you
reproach yourself for your weakness and then get right back on track.
    Your code probably includes moderation, respect for others, cleanliness,
and other characteristics that most people would agree are virtues,
while you eschew their opposites: sloth, greed, gluttony, and so on.

    You gain the following characteristics:

Dauntless:
    +2 to your Might Pool.

    Skill:
    You are trained in discerning people’s true motives or seeing
    through lies.

    Skill:
    Your adherence to a strict moral code has hardened your mind
    against fear, doubt, and outside influence. You are trained in Intellect

    1. The PCs are doing something virtuous, and you’re all about that.

    3. One of the other PCs invited you, hearing of your virtuous ways.
    4. You put virtue before sense and defended someone’s honor in the face of an organization or power far greater than you. You joined the PCs because they offered aid and friendship when, out of fear of reprisals, no one else would.

    -----

You aren’t like anyone else, and that’s fine with you. People don’t seem
to understand you—they even seem put off by you—but who cares? You
        understand the world better than they do because you’re weird, and so is
the world you live in. The concept of “the weird” is well known to you.
    Strange devices, ancient locales, bizarre creatures, storms that can
transform you, living energy fields, conspiracies, aliens, and things
most people can’t even name populate the world, and you thrive on them.
    You have a special attachment to it all, and the more you discover about
the weirdness in the world, the more you might discover about yourself.

    Weird characters might be mutants or people born with strange qualities,
but sometimes they started out “normal” and adopted the weird by choice.

    You gain the following characteristics:

Inner Light:
    +2 to your Intellect Pool.

    Distinctive Physical Quirk:
    You have a unique physical aspect that is,
    well, bizarre. Depending on the setting, this can vary greatly. You
    might have purple hair or metal spikes on your head. Perhaps your hands
    don’t connect to your arms, although they move as if they do. Maybe a
    third eye stares out from the side of your head, or superfluous tendrils
    grow from your back. Whatever it is, your quirk might be a mutation, a
    supernatural trait (a blessing or curse), a feature with no explanation,
    or just a really wild tattoo that draws a lot of attention.

    A Sense for the Weird:
        Sometimes—at the GM’s discretion—weird things
    relating to the supernatural or its effects on the world seem to call
    out to you. You can sense them from afar, and if you get within long
    range of such a thing, you can sense whether it is overtly dangerous or
    not.

    Skill:
    You are trained in supernatural knowledge.

    Inability:
    People find you unnerving. All tasks relating to pleasant
    social interaction are hindered.

    Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:
    From the following list of
        options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

    1. It seemed weird, so why not?
        2. Whether the other PCs realize it or not, their mission has to do with something weird that you know about, so you got involved.
    3. As an expert in the weird, you were specifically recruited by the other PCs.
    4. You felt drawn to join the other PCs, but you don’t know why.
